This file constains instruction for running the 
project on Debian9-based machines. That means that
it should work on Ubuntu as well (not tested yet).

Follow these steps:

1) Install dotnet core. Don't botter on looking for
the proper documentation because I did it already and 
created a script that can do that for you. Run the 
script named "dotnet_install.sh" and be happy.

2) Use VisualStudio Code. Why? 
- First nice reason:
it install all dependencies automatically for your
project, so you will be free from the task of installing
NuGet stuff. 
- Second nice reason: it works on windows, linux and mac.
- Third nice reason: it is lightweight and runs on trashy 
machines like mine.
To install VisualStudio code, run the script named "vscode_install.sh".

3) You can boost your VisualStudio Code experience by
installing some extensions. I do know VisualStudio Code 
so well for automating this task (yet), but I made a list
of the best extension and a short tutorial on how to install 
them. Follow the instructions in "vscode_ext_list.txt"
